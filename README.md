# json_intro

JSON-(Javascript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy to read and write.

This walkthrough uses JSON data of exchange rates which is parsed using a JSON gem into a hash, so individual information can be extracted.

This hash containing information of the exchange rate is then tested to see if it is working and returning values as it should.
